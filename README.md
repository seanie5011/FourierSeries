# FourierSeries

A project where visualisation of various Fourier Series is implemented. This is done in `C++` using `SFML 2.6.0`, with the `mingw32` compiler.

## Installing and running

1. Ensure `SFML 2.6.0` has been installed and statically linked.
2. Navigate to the desired implementations directory and open a terminal.
3. Type `mingw32-make all` to create an executable.
4. Open the executable.

## Implementation

This uses the method as discussed in [The Coding Train](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCodingTrain)'s video [*Coding Challenge 125: Fourier Series*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Mm2eYfj0SgA&ab_channel=TheCodingTrain). Along with the following articles by Bilcigan Dede: [*Purrier Series (Meow) and Making Images Speak*](https://bilimneguzellan.net/en/purrier-series-meow-and-making-images-speak/) and [*Follow up to Fourier Series*](https://bilimneguzellan.net/en/follow-up-to-fourier-series-2/).
